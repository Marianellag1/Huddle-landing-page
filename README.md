## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I went over the recorded class videos and re-learned things I looked over because I was so new at coding. It helped extremely to keep in mind 
small useful tips in keeping the code clean. I feel that with these two codes, I felt so proud of myself in how they ended up working.
And I will continue to use especially the first one because to me it just makes sense.
```css
:root {
    --violet: hsl(257, 40%, 49%);
    --magenta: hsl(300, 69%, 71%);
}

body {
    background-image: url("../../images/bg-desktop.svg");
}
```

### Continued development

I, for some reason that cannot figure out now, had difficulty connecting the button to style.css for color change or for active state. I would 
like to find out why, and make the code clean by iliminating any style.css in index.html and finally having it be in the actual style.css/
